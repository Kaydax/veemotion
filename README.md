*You lip-sync, we drip ink.*

Mouse-and-keyboard-to-pro-controller adapter. Connects via bluetooth. Uses https://github.com/tehZevo/joycontrol (thanks to upstream devs mart1nro and Poohl!)

## Developers
* [tehZevo](https://github.com/tehZevo): implementation
* [Chrono](https://github.com/Chrono-byte): came up with the repo name :^)
* [Kaydax](https://github.com/Kaydax): debugging/testing

## TODO
* docs
* actually test this darn thing
* automatically reconnect when disconnected
* load/save switch mac address from/to config
* add pro controller color customization?
* right joycon only mode so you can joycon + mouse (gl binding enough buttons though)
* improve keybindings
  * consider booyah!ing
* fix create_future crash on python 3.10 (upstream joycontrol bug) (might be fixed now?)

## Notes
* may need to install python(3.9)-dev
